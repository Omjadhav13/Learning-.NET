# Learning-.NET

## ðŸ“– Repo Description

**Learning-.NET** is a personal repository created to document my journey of learning and exploring the C# programming language and the .NET ecosystem. It contains a collection of small practice programs, sample code snippets, and concept-based implementations that cover core topics such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and other object-oriented programming principles in C#.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in C# by writing clean, simple, and focused code for each concept, while gradually progressing toward more advanced topics. Each file or folder represents a specific topic or day of learning, making it easy to refer back to examples when needed.

This repository serves both as a personal learning log and a helpful reference for anyone starting with C# and .NET.
